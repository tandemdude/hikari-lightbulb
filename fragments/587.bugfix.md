### Fix group unloading in client.unload_extensions

The issue was that when unloading a group, only the top-level group was
removed from the _command_invocation_mapping, but the subcommand paths
remained. This happened because Client.unregister() only removes the
command from collections but doesn't handle the hierarchical nature of
groups and subcommands.

The fix ensures that when a group is unloaded, all of its subcommands
are also properly removed from the command invocation mapping by
identifying all command paths that start with the group's name and
removing them from the mapping.
