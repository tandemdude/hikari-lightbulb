=============

- ``bucket`` attribute has been added to the :obj:`~lightbulb.errors.MaxConcurrencyLimitReached` class.

Version 2.0.0
=============

This version is a complete rewrite of the API. Almost everything has been rewritten from scratch so don't expect
much, if any, of the API to be the same as in version 1.

**Changes**

- Lightbulb is now fully typed and mypy compliant.

- Slight memory usage improvements.

- Added ability to do ``python -m lightbulb`` to give basic version information.

- Rename ``lightbulb.Bot`` to ``lightbulb.BotApp``.

- Complete rewrite of the method used to define commands. See :ref:`commands-guide` for details on the new method.
    - Prefix and slash commands are now defined the same way, and single functions can implement any combination of commands.

    - Options (arguments) are now defined using the :obj:`lightbulb.decorators.option` decorator instead of parsing the command signature.

- Plugins are no longer defined as classes. See :ref:`plugins-guide` for details on the new method of defining and using plugins.

- Contexts now all have the same interface. :obj:`lightbulb.context.base.Context` is the base class.

- Help command has been completely overhauled.
    - Removed ``get_command_signature`` function in favour of a ``signature`` property on command objects.

- Application command management and change detection has been completely overhauled.

- Some errors have been removed, new errors have been added.

- Custom converters have been overhauled to use a base class instead of being functions :obj:`lightbulb.converters.base.BaseConverter`.

- Added ability to automatically defer responses to commands, as well as the ability to send all responses from a command
  as ephemeral by default.

- Rewrite permission checks.

- Added many more event types for the additional types of commands available.

- Minor changes to cooldown implementation.

- Added data store module to assist with storing data in the bot (and optionally plugin) instance(s).

- Refactor argument parsing for prefix commands to allow you to drop in your own implementation.

- Minor changes to navigator and paginator implementation - you shouldn't notice these in normal use.

- Command and context classes moved up a level to their respective sub-modules. You can no longer access them with ``lightbulb.x``
  you need to instead do ``lightbulb.commands|context.x``

- Prefix command groups, subgroups and subcommands now **require** separate classes.

- Added guides section in the documentation.

- Changed documentation theme.
