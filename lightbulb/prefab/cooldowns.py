    This hook is run during the ``COOLDOWNS`` execution step.

    You can pass one of ``"global"``, ``"user"``, ``"channel"`` or ``"guild"`` to the ``bucket`` parameter, or
    a synchronous or asynchronous function to be used to resolve the bucket hash to apply the cooldown to.

    - ``"global"`` - every invocation of the command shares a common cooldown
    - ``"user"`` - cooldown is applied individually for each user
    - ``"channel"`` - cooldown is applied individually for each channel
    - ``"guild"`` - cooldown is applied individually for each guild. If in DMs, the cooldown is applied individually to
      each DM.

        window_length: The length of the cooldown window.
        allowed_invocations: The number of invocations allowed within one window.
