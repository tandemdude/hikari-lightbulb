    Data storage class allowing setting, retrieval and unsetting of custom
    attributes. This class subclasses :obj:`dict` so the data can be accessed the same
    as you would a dictionary as well as using dot notation.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> d = DataStore()
            >>> d.foo = "bar"
            >>> d.foo

            DataStore(foo='bar')
            >>> d.pop("foo")

        Helper method to allow type-complete getting of items from this ``DataStore``.

        Args:
            item (:obj:`str`): The name of the key that the item is stored at.
            type (Type[T]): The type to cast the item as.

            This does **not** verify types, it just performs a :meth:`typing.cast` to fool the
            type system into thinking that the return value is of the correct type.
