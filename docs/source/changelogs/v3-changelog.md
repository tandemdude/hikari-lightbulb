<!-- next-changelog -->

## v3.0.0a16 (2025-03-21)
### Features

- Implement user installable application commands. ([#536](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/536))

----

## v3.0.0a15 (2024-11-22)
### Features

- `Menu.attach` now returns an instance of `MenuHandle` instead of a generic awaitable - allowing the menu to be stopped without using a `MenuContext` or timeout.

### Bugfixes

- Changed logging level for exceptions happening in tasks from `WARNING` to `ERROR`. ([#486](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/486))
- Fix sporadic attribute error when using `self.previous_row()` within a component menu class.

----

## v3.0.0a14 (2024-10-30)
### Bugfixes

- Fixed lightbulb.attachment option, which previously compiled to hikari.OptionType.MENTIONABLE ([#472](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/472))

### Miscellaneous

- Add support for Python 3.13

----

## v3.0.0a13 (2024-09-30)
### Features

- - Implement injection for union dependencies using `Foo | Bar`. If any of the requested dependencies are not registered, it will fall back to the next in the union.
  - Implement injection for optional dependencies using `Foo | None`. If all the requested dependencies are not registered, it will fall back to `None`.
  - Implement injection 'meta annotations' (`Try[]` and `If[]`) allowing modifying of the fall-back behaviour.

  ([#454](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/454))
- Add `name` argument to the `hook()` decorator and `name` attribute to `ExecutionHook`.
- Prefab cooldown hooks now register an instance of `CommandCooldown` as a dependency when they are executed.

### Bugfixes

- Fix `KeyError` preventing error handlers being loaded from extensions.
- Fix menu task exceptions being logged even if they were raised previously.

----

## v3.0.0a12 (2024-08-30)
### Breaking Changes

- `Menu.attach` now has the `wait` parameter set to `True` by default, and the `timeout` parameter set to `30s` by default.

### Bugfixes

- Fix DI creating a new default container every time instead of reusing the existing one.
- Fixed DI failing when trying to create dependencies with more complex dependency trees.

----

## v3.0.0a11 (2024-08-29)
### Bugfixes

- - Improved container hierarchical dependency resolution process.
  - Add significantly more `DEBUG` logging throughout the DI pipeline.
  - `DependencyInjectionManager.enter_context` now needs to be called for every context you wish to enter; it will no longer enter the default context automatically.
  - `DependencyInjectionManager.enter_context` now searches the existing container hierarchy to find an existing container for the passed context before trying to create a new one.
  - `DependencyInjectionManager.enter_context` now returns a no-op container implementation instead of `None` if DI is disabled globally.

  ([#449](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/449))
- Fix default injection container being closed when explicitly entering the `DEFAULT` DI context.

### Features

- Add `has_roles` check to the `prefab` subpackage. ([#447](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/447))
- Add `set_timeout` method to `MenuContext`. ([#448](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/448))
- Add `client` attribute to `ModalContext` and `MenuContext`.
- Add `enable_all_components` and `disable_all_components` methods to `Menu`.
- Add `registered_commands` and `invokable_commands` properties to `Client`.

----

## v3.0.0a10 (2024-08-15)
### Documentation

- Update code examples for version 3 from version 2. ([#436](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/436))

### Features

- Add a component and modal handler implementation. You can use these to more easily handle the creation and execution
  of message components, as well as submitted modal forms. ([#438](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/438))

### Deprecations and Removals

- The `ephemeral` argument for `Context.defer()` is now keyword-only.

----

## v3.0.0a9 (2024-08-08)
### Features

- Add `prefab` subpackage containing some simple built-in hooks. More will continue to be added.
- `utils.get_command_data()` now works for groups and subgroups.

### Miscellaneous

- Switch to using types from `collections.abc` instead of `typing` wherever possible.

----

## v3.0.0a8 (2024-07-29)
### Features

- Add `hooks` parameter to `client_from_app` - allowing commands to inherit common hooks from the client. ([#430](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/430))

### Bugfixes

- Fix autocomplete callbacks not being called if the option had localization enabled.
- Fix command parameter validation failing sometimes when using long localization keys.
- Fix subcommands with localization enabled not being invoked as expected.
- Slightly improved performance of invoking nested subcommands.

### Deprecations and Removals

- - `Client.register_deferred` has been removed. You should now use `Client.register(defer_guilds=True)` instead.

  - `guilds` kwarg for `Client.register` has new semantics. Read the docstring for more information.

  ([#429](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/429))
- Removed `HookFailedException`. `ExecutionPipelineFailedException` now has two attributes containing the hooks that
  failed, and the exception that caused them to fail. You may need to update your error handler to reflect this.

----

## v3.0.0a7 (2024-07-23)
### Features

- Dependency injection system has been completely rewritten to make it much more flexible and powerful. See the
  dependencies guide on the 'By Examples' page for details on the new implementation. ([#428](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/428))

### Deprecations and Removals

- - Removed `lightbulb.with_di`, it has been replaced by `lightbulb.di.with_di`
  - Removed `lightbulb.INJECTED`, it has been replaced by `lightbulb.di.INJECTED`
  - Removed `Client.di.register_dependency` - see the dependencies guide for details on the replacement

  ([#428](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/428))

----

## v3.0.0a6 (2024-07-18)
### Features

- Add support for unloading and atomic reloading of extensions.
- Implement repeating tasks - including uniform and cron-based triggers and support within extensions.

### Bugfixes

- Fix limit for message ID length for options name and description when using `GnuLocalizationProvider`. ([#427](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/427))
- Fix localization not being supported correctly for commands using deferred guild registration.

### Deprecations and Removals

- The `unload()` method is now required to be implemented for `Loader`s.

----

## v3.0.0a5 (2024-07-13)
### Features

- Refactor `ExecutionPipelineFailedException` to make writing error handlers more intuitive.

### Bugfixes

- Fix incorrect assertion error happening sometimes when a subcommand is invoked.

----

## v3.0.0a4 (2024-07-02)
### Features

- Add `ephemeral` convenience argument to `Context.respond`.
- Add ability to localize choice names.

----

## v3.0.0a3 (2024-06-28)
### Features

- Add `PRE_INVOKE` execution step to default execution step order.
- Add ability for `Loadable.listener`s to listen for multiple event types.

### Bugfixes

- Fix not being able to access option values when their name and description are localized.

----

## v3.0.0a2 (2024-06-20)
### Features

- A [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24669-hikari-lightbulb-support) for IntelliJ-based IDEs has been 
  released to add autocompletion and type checking support for command parameters. It supports Lightbulb from 
  this version and later. More features are planned.

### Bugfixes

- Use `interaction.registered_guild_id` when resolving command interactions to prevent issues where guild commands
  would sometimes be invoked instead of global commands. ([#426](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/426))

### Improved Documentation

- Documentation has been reworked to look nicer and function better. A Lightbulb-by-example section is in-progress for
  better tutorials and explanations for users of the library.

----

## v3.0.0a1 (2024-06-09)
### Features

- Add `lightbulb.INJECTED` flag for dependency injection typing improvements ([#424](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/424))
