class MaxConcurrencyReached(Exception):
    """Exception raised when a user attempts to invoke a command, but the concurrency limit has been reached."""


def max_concurrency(n_invocations: int, bucket: Bucket) -> tuple[execution.ExecutionHook, execution.ExecutionHook]:
    """
    Creates hooks that enforce a concurrency limit for a **single** command. The created hooks raise
    :obj:`~MaxConcurrencyReached` when they fail. The created hooks are run during the ``MAX_CONCURRENCY`` and
    ``POST_INVOKE`` execution steps. As this returns **multiple** hooks, you should unpack them into the hooks list
    for your command - see the example for details.

    Args:
        n_invocations: The number of invocations permitted to be running at the same time.
        bucket: The bucket which invocations should be limited within. Accepts the same values that the
            cooldowns do.

    Returns:
        The created hooks.

    Warning:
        **DO NOT** use the same hooks for multiple commands - this will cause the concurrency limit to be
        shared between them. Make sure you call this function a single time for each command you wish to enforce
        a concurrency limit with.

    Warning:
        If you add any other checks for the ``POST_INVOKE`` execution step, you should probably specify them
        before these in the hooks list for the command - otherwise the concurrency limit will be decreased before
        the other ``POST_INVOKE`` hooks have been run.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            class YourCommand(
                ...,
                hooks=[..., *lightbulb.prefab.max_concurrency(1, "global")]
            ):
                ...
