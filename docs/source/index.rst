Lightbulb
=========

Lightbulb is a command handler library designed for use with `Hikari <https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari>`_

It aims to provide an easy to use interface for building commands with your bot.

Repository: `View on GitHub <https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb>`_

Docs: `View Here <https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/>`_

If you need any help with this library or hikari at any point feel free to join the `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/Jx4cNGG>`_

If you think you have found a bug or other problem with the library, or you would like to suggest a feature,
you should submit an issue on the GitHub repository `here <https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues>`_.
Before doing so you should make sure you are on the latest version of the library and check to see if an issue
already exists for your bug or feature.

Also see `Tanjun <https://fasterspeeding.github.io/Tanjun/master/>`_ if you would prefer different command handler
syntax. Tanjun could be considered more powerful than Lightbulb for advanced applications, however it has a far
steeper learning curve for new programmers, and programmers transitioning from discord.py. I reccommend taking a
look at both Lightbulb and Tanjun before choosing which one you wish to use for your bot.
