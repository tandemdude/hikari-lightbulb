This module implements simple asynchronous tasks that run alongside the Lightbulb client.

Usage Guide
-----------

Creating Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tasks can be created using one of the provided decorators:

- :meth:`@client.task() <lightbulb.client.Client.task>`
- :meth:`@loader.task() <lightbulb.loaders.Loader.task>`

When creating a task, you must pass a trigger callable that will be used to know when and how often the task
should be invoked.

Built-in Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lightbulb has two built-in triggers that you can use for your own tasks. These are
:obj:`~lightbulb.tasks.uniformtrigger` and :obj:`~lightbulb.tasks.crontrigger`.

**uniformtrigger**

When used, this trigger will invoke the task at the given uniform interval. I.e. if you set the interval to
10 seconds, the task will be invoked every 10 seconds. The countdown before each invocation will start once
the previous invocation has finished.

**crontrigger**

.. important::
    To use this trigger you need to install Lightbulb with the optional dependency ``[crontrigger]``

When used, this trigger invokes the task following the given crontab. For example, you could use this trigger
to schedule the task to run every day at 10am. This trigger's schedule is always calculated from UTC.

Custom Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating your own custom trigger is easy. A trigger is any callable that takes a single parameter - this will be
an instance of :obj:`~lightbulb.tasks.TaskExecutionData` - and returns a float. This will be called after every
invocation of the task in order to calculate how much time to wait until the next task invocation.

The task execution data object contains some information you can use if you wish to set next the interval based on
when the task was last invoked, or how long the last invocation took.

Running Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tasks registered to the client will be run automatically once the client's ``start`` method has been called. Any
tasks registered after the client has already been started will be run immediately. If, when creating your task,
you pass ``auto_start=False``, then you will instead need to call the task's start method manually.

If the task is registered to a loader, once the loader is removed from the client the task will be cancelled.

def uniformtrigger(

    """
    Generates a trigger function that returns uniform intervals from the given arguments. At least one
    of ``seconds``, ``minutes``, and ``hours`` must be specified. If multiple are specified then the
    intervals will be combined. I.e. if ``hours`` is ``1`` AND ``seconds`` is ``5``, then the generated interval
    will be ``3605`` seconds (1 hour 5 seconds).

    Args:
        seconds: The number of seconds for the interval.
        minutes: The number of minutes for the interval.
        hours: The number of hours for the interval.
        wait_first: Whether the first invocation of the task should wait for the interval to elapse. Defaults to
            :obj:`True`.

    Returns:
        The generated trigger function.

    Raises:
        :obj:`ValueError`: When all interval arguments are 0, or any interval argument is negative.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @client.task(lightbulb.uniformtrigger(minutes=1))
            async def print_hi() -> None:

def crontrigger(tab: str) -> Callable[[TaskExecutionData], float]:
    """
    Generates a crontab-based task trigger. Tasks will be run dependent on the given crontab. You can use a tool
    such as `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru/>`_ to aid in creating an appropriate crontab.

    Args:
        tab: The crontab to use to schedule task execution.

    Returns:
        The generated trigger function.

    Note:
        The crontab is **always** evaluated using UTC time.

    Warning:
        This trigger is not available unless you have the ``croniter`` requirement installed. For convenience, you
        can install this using the '[crontrigger]' option when installing Lightbulb.

        E.g. ``pip install hikari-lightbulb[crontrigger]``

    Warning:
        If the task execution takes longer than the interval specified by the crontab, the next execution will
        take place at the next suitable time after the execution completed. For example, if you specify the task
        should run at every 5th minute, but the execution at the 0th minute takes 6 minutes - the task would next
        be executed at the 10th minute instead of the 5th minute.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Crontab '* * * * *' means 'run at every minute'
            @client.task(lightbulb.crontrigger("* * * * *"))

    Class representing an asynchronous repeating task.

        trigger: The trigger function to use to resolve the interval between task executions.
        auto_start: Whether the task should be started automatically. This means that if the task is added to
            the client upon the client being started, the task will also be started; it will also be started
            if being added to an already-started client.
        max_failures: The maximum number of failed attempts to execute the task before it is cancelled.
            Setting this to a negative number will prevent the task from being cancelled, regardless of
            how often the task fails.
