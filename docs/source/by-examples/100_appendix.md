## Components and Modals

Lightbulb includes a component handler (and modal handler) that you can use to make processing component and modal
interactions easier than it otherwise would be using raw Hikari code. For a usage guide you should see the
documentation for the {obj}`components subpackage <lightbulb.components>`.
