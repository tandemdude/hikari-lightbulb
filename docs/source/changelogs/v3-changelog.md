<!-- next-changelog -->

## v3.0.0a8 (2024-07-29)

### Features

- Add `hooks` parameter to `client_from_app` - allowing commands to inherit common hooks from the client. ([#430](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/430))

### Bugfixes

- Fix autocomplete callbacks not being called if the option had localization enabled.
- Fix command parameter validation failing sometimes when using long localization keys.
- Fix subcommands with localization enabled not being invoked as expected.
- Slightly improved performance of invoking nested subcommands.

### Deprecations and Removals

- - `Client.register_deferred` has been removed. You should now use `Client.register(defer_guilds=True)` instead.

  - `guilds` kwarg for `Client.register` has new semantics. Read the docstring for more information.

  ([#429](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/429))
- Removed `HookFailedException`. `ExecutionPipelineFailedException` now has two attributes containing the hooks that
  failed, and the exception that caused them to fail. You may need to update your error handler to reflect this.

----

## v3.0.0a7 (2024-07-23)

### Features

- Dependency injection system has been completely rewritten to make it much more flexible and powerful. See the
  dependencies guide on the 'By Examples' page for details on the new implementation. ([#428](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/428))

### Deprecations and Removals

- - Removed `lightbulb.with_di`, it has been replaced by `lightbulb.di.with_di`
  - Removed `lightbulb.INJECTED`, it has been replaced by `lightbulb.di.INJECTED`
  - Removed `Client.di.register_dependency` - see the dependencies guide for details on the replacement

  ([#428](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/428))

## v3.0.0a6 (2024-07-18)

### Features

- Add support for unloading and atomic reloading of extensions.
- Implement repeating tasks - including uniform and cron-based triggers and support within extensions.

### Bugfixes

- Fix limit for message ID length for options name and description when using `GnuLocalizationProvider`. ([#427](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/427))
- Fix localization not being supported correctly for commands using deferred guild registration.

### Deprecations and Removals

- The `unload()` method is now required to be implemented for `Loader`s.

----

## v3.0.0a5 (2024-07-13)

### Features

- Refactor `ExecutionPipelineFailedException` to make writing error handlers more intuitive.

### Bugfixes

----

## v3.0.0a4 (2024-07-02)

### Features

- Add `ephemeral` convenience argument to `Context.respond`.

----

## v3.0.0a2 (2024-06-20)

### Features

- A [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24669-hikari-lightbulb-support) for IntelliJ-based IDEs has been 
  released to add autocompletion and type checking support for command parameters. It supports Lightbulb from 
  this version and later. More features are planned.

### Bugfixes

- Use `interaction.registered_guild_id` when resolving command interactions to prevent issues where guild commands
  would sometimes be invoked instead of global commands. ([#426](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/426))

### Improved Documentation

- Documentation has been reworked to look nicer and function better. A Lightbulb-by-example section is in-progress for
  better tutorials and explanations for users of the library.

### Features

- Add `lightbulb.INJECTED` flag for dependency injection typing improvements ([#424](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb/issues/424))
