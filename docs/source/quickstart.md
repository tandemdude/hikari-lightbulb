# Quickstart

Lightbulb can be installed using pip:
:::{prompt}
:language: bash

pip install --pre hikari-lightbulb
:::

:::{important}
You must have Python 3.10 or higher in order to use hikari-lightbulb.

## Creating Your First Bot

Your first bot can be written in just a few lines of code:
```python
# Import the libraries
import hikari
import lightbulb

# Create a GatewayBot instance
bot = hikari.GatewayBot("your_token_here")
client = lightbulb.client_from_app(bot)

# Ensure the client will be started when the bot is run
bot.subscribe(hikari.StartingEvent, client.start)

# Register the command with the client
@client.register()
class Ping(
    # Command type - builtins include SlashCommand, UserCommand, and MessageCommand
    lightbulb.SlashCommand,
    # Command declaration parameters
    name="ping",
    description="checks the bot is alive",
):
    # Define the command's invocation method. This method must take the context as the first
    # argument (excluding self) which contains information about the command invocation.
    @lightbulb.invoke
    async def invoke(self, ctx: lightbulb.Context) -> None:
        # Send a message to the channel the command was used in
        await ctx.respond("Pong!")

# Run the bot
# Note that this is blocking meaning no code after this line will run
# until the bot is shut off
bot.run()
```

When this code is run, you will get some logging information and a Hikari banner printed across your
terminal. The bot will be online, and you can test out the command!

## Optional: Setting up logging

Lightbulb uses the `logging` library for the logging of useful information for debugging and testing purposes.
This can be changed by using the `logs` argument of the `GatewayBot` constructor. Alternatively, you can use
`logging` directly.

Changing the logging level with using the `logs` argument:
```py
import hikari

# Set to debug for both lightbulb and hikari
bot = hikari.GatewayBot(..., logs="DEBUG")
...

bot.run()
```

Using different logging levels for both `hikari` and `lightbulb`:
```python
import hikari

# Set different logging levels for both lightbulb and hikari
bot = hikari.GatewayBot(
    ...,
    logs={
        "version": 1,
        "incremental": True,
        "loggers": {
            "hikari": {"level": "INFO"},
            "hikari.ratelimits": {"level": "TRACE_HIKARI"},
            "lightbulb": {"level": "DEBUG"},
        },
    },
)
...

bot.run()
```

:::{note}
Usually you should set the logging level to `logging.INFO` as setting it to debug can cause a lot
of console spam, possibly impacting the performance of your program.
